Its been 45 days since lockdown in most countries in the world because of Covid-19 former name nCov, nowadays the new norm is that eveybody is bringing their own alcohol sanitizers and wearing mask when outside. You can see in every apartments/condominium lobbies, grocery stores and offices are having alchol based sanitizers right before you enter the primises that you need to pump it using your hands and some people they dont bother using it because of fear that the last person who used it might be infected. So ive come up with the touchless alcohol dispenser that uses ultrasonic sensor that triggers water pump to flow the  

This touchless alcohol dispenser is based on arduino and using ultrasonic sensor, Mosfet, and Submersible Waterpump. There are lot of touchless alcohol dispenser out there but mostly are too complex to follow and the meterials are very hard to find especially this trying time. I designed this in a way that it can be housed easily either in a cardboard, a wood board, an arcylic board or a pvc board.

### Housing

For housing you can use wood, cardboard, pvc board, sintra board each of this has pros and cons.

1. Cardboard - Easy to cut using sharp cutter and joining them together using stick glue easypeasy. Disadvantage is that its not waterproof alcohol spillage will cause the cardboard to wringkle.

2. PVC Board - Easy to cut using hacksaw with finer teeth and joining them using pvc glue or pvc cement, problem its hard to find some supplier this trying time. Its waterproof and no need to paint it and probably the most recommeded. Be careful to sniff some plastic particles wear your N95 mask when cutting.

3. Wood - with 3-4mm thickness using hacksaw its easy peasy but its dusty when cutting it make sure to use your N95 Mask. You may use wood glue to stick the board together.
